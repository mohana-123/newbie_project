# newbie_project
The newbie college website creation project is an exciting endeavor undertaken by me studying web development at the college. The objective of this project is to design and develop a user-friendly website of my own college, serving as an online hub of information and interaction for students, faculty, and visitors.

The website's main features will include a homepage that showcases the college's identity, mission, and core values. It will also provide detailed information about academic programs, faculty members, admission procedures, and campus facilities. 

To encourage interaction and community engagement, the website will include  students chapters. Additionally, there will be a news and events section to keep the college community informed about the latest happenings, including seminars, workshops, and social gatherings.
I created this to test my skills of web development.
